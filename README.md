# General Disclaimers
- This project is created by Andrei Treil and Sebastian McKay
- For all implementations, we used Andrei Treil's versions of the code, either by creating python files such as ```NeuralNet.py``` and ```RandomForest.py``` or by copying and pasting the code directly into cells
# Dependencies
- Written in Python 3.9.13
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, random, sklearn
# Running the Code
- Source code must be in same directory as all datasets
- Must include ```NeuralNet.py``` and ```RandomForest.py``` in the same directory
- Must include my version of ```final_script.py``` in same directory
- Original file is ```final.ipynb```, if you are able running all code cells like this is ideal
- Otherwise, running  ```final.py``` in a directory containing previously mentioned files will run all code at once through Python.
- **Warning**: Running the code in its entirety at once will take a long time, to avoid this, we suggest deleting multiple runs of hyper parameter tuning
