# Running the Code
- Source code must be in same directory as all datasets
- Must include ```NeuralNet.py``` and ```RandomForest.py``` in the same directory
- Must include my version of ```final_script.py``` in same directory
- Original file is ```final.ipynb```, if you are able running all code cells like this is ideal
- Otherwise, running  ```final.py``` in a directory containing previously mentioned files will run all code at once through Python.
